  <p>Mechanical waves are waves that need a meduim
    to travel through. Mechanical waves do not exist in outer
    space because there is no matter in space (that's why
    you can't hear sound in space). These waves travel faster
    through dense matter, such as solids, and slower through
    less dense matter, like gases.<br>
    <br>
    <b>A medium is matter through which a wave travels through.</b></p>

  <h2> Types of Mechanical Waves</h2>
  <p>There are two types of mechanical waves, transverse waves and
     longitudinal waves.<br><br></p>

  <h3>Transverse Waves</h3>
  <p>Transverse waves are waves that move up and down, the energy
     they carry moves <b>perpendicular</b> to the wave. Transverse waves
     have a trough, a crest, an amplitude, and a wavelength.
     A <b>crest</b> is the highest point on a wave, and a <b>trough</b> is the
     lowest. The <b>amplitude</b> of a wave is the height of a wave. The
     <b>wavelength</b> is the length of a wave.<br> Examples of Transverse
      waves inlude people doing the wave during sports events, light waves,
      and water waves.</p>

    <h3>Longitudinal Waves</h3>
    <p>Longitudnal waves (also known as compression waves) are waves that
      move <b>parallel</b> to the energy they carry. They have a compression,
      a rarefaction, and a wavelength (just like transverse waves).
      a <b>compression</b> is the part of the longitudinal wave where the
      particles are close together and a <b>rarefaction</b> is where the
      particles are more spread out.<br> Examples of longitudinal waves
      are slinkies, sound waves, and tsunami waves.</p>
