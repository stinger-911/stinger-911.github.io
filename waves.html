  <h2>What is a wave? </h2>
  <p>A wave is a rythmic disturbance that carries energy through matter or space.
     There are two main types of waves, mechanical waves and electomagnetic
     waves.</p>
  <p>Waves are made through oscillatory motion (or simple harmonic motion).
     <b>Oscillatory motion,</b> or<b> simple harmonic motion</b>, is the
     repeated motion in which an object repeats the same movement over and over.
     There are many different types of waves and they are used for many
     different things. They exist all around us and help with many things
     that we use today, such as our phones, the internet, sounds, ligth,
     medicine, and many more things. </p>
